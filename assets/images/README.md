# Profile Photo Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Photo

1. **Save your profile photo** in this folder (`assets/images/`)
2. **Name it**: `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png` if it's a PNG file)
3. **If using a different name**, update the image path in `index.html`:
   - Find: `<img src="assets/images/profile.jpg"`
   - Change to: `<img src="assets/images/YOUR_FILENAME.jpg"`

## Supported Formats
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## Recommended Size
- **Minimum**: 500x500 pixels
- **Optimal**: 800x800 pixels or larger
- The website will automatically resize it to fit

## Current Setup
The website is currently set to look for `profile.jpg` in this folder. If the image is not found, it will show a placeholder.
